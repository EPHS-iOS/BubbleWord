# BubbleWord
Bubble Word is a game that uses a bubble shooter style turret and releases a ball that hits one of 30 randomly spawned letters. The goal is to spell out a word and click the check. The app will then check to see if it's a word and then adds the respective scrabble letter values to a score. The hardest part of developing this app was to find a way to include the dictionary to check and see if the inputted word was really a word. There was a compromise by having a large dictionary that check through words of length 8 or less. Assets and looks of the app have been updated throughout the time spent on this app, to reach a state of satisfaction.
